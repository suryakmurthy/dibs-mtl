# DiBS-MTL
This repository contains the experiment implementations for **"DiBS-MTL: Transformation-Invariant Multitask Learning with Direction Oracles".**
This repository contains two subdirectories:

- `mtl/`  — Code used for the Illustrative Example and NYUv2 Multitask Learning Experiment.
- `mtrl/` — Code used for the Metaworld MT10 Multitask Reinforcement Learning Experiment.

Each of these subdirectories includes a separate README that covers how to set up and run the experiments.
